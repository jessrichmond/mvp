# hi haiku: an app
*tell em how you feel
for real. in exactly three 
lines: 5-7-5.*

For those needing a break, for those interested in the ideas of others, and for those keen to share, ***Hi Haiku*** gently challenges users to express themselves creatively within a constraint of simplicity. 

Traditionally a Japanese art form, haiku encourages practitioners to be impressed upon by the physical world in which they inhabit. Hi Haiku takes this idea and melds it with a sense of connection.

have my react components load
